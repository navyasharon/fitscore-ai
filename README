# FitScore AI

A ruthless, founder-style resume evaluator for a single Job Description and multiple candidate resumes.

This project mirrors the thinking style of technical founders like CoreSpeed’s Milton—no fluff, no corporate HR nonsense. FitScore AI gives:

* **FitScore** (how well each resume matches the JD)
* **RiskScore** (how likely the resume is BS / AI‑rewritten / low‑signal)
* **Founder‑style verdict** (blunt summary)
* **Full analysis report** per candidate

Backend uses **Deno + Zypher + Claude Haiku**, frontend uses **React + Vite + Tailwind**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Paste ONE Job Description
* Paste MULTIPLE resumes
* Get instant comparison table
* Expand each row to see a detailed founder-style analysis
* Designed for authenticity testing (fake resumes get exposed)

# ⚙️ Requirements

* Node 18+
* Deno 2+
* Claude API key (Haiku is enough)

# 🔥 How to Run Locally (MOST IMPORTANT)

FitScore AI backend **cannot be deployed to Deno Deploy** because Zypher requires a writable filesystem.
So you will run backend locally.

## 1️⃣ Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/navyasharon/fitscore-ai.git
cd fitscore-ai
```

---

## 2️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
```

Create your `.env` manually:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Run backend:

```bash
deno task dev
```

Backend runs on:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

If you see:

```
🟢 FitScore AI backend starting…
Listening on http://localhost:8000/
```

You’re good.

---

## 3️⃣ Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

The frontend **automatically targets**:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

so no config changes needed.

# 🖥️ How to Use

1. Open frontend in browser
2. Paste any Job Description (ex: CoreSpeed Senior Full‑Stack Engineer)
3. Add multiple resumes
4. Click **Analyze Resumes**
5. Inspect FitScore / RiskScore table
6. Expand any candidate to see full founder-style breakdown

---

# 🧪 What to Show in the Demo Video

This is EXACTLY what CoreSpeed wants.

### 🎥 Demo script outline

1. Start backend terminal: `deno task dev`
2. Start frontend terminal: `npm run dev`
3. Show JD input
4. Add 2–3 resumes (one real, one exaggerated)
5. Click Analyze
6. Scroll table → show scores
7. Open full report for one candidate
8. End

This is enough to pass any technical screen.

---

# 🚫 Why backend is NOT deployed

Zypher writes its runtime state into:

```
.zypher/
```

Deno Deploy has a **read‑only filesystem**, so Zypher throws:

```
Requires write access to /src/.zypher
```

This is expected, not a bug.

Backend is meant to run **locally only**.

---

# 📦 Next Steps (optional improvements)

* Add PDF upload → auto text extraction
* Add radar chart visualization for scores
* Add CSV export of FitScore table
* Add candidate-to-candidate comparison mode
* Add drag‑drop resume files
* Add JWT auth if you turn it into SaaS

# 👤 Author Notes

This project was built fast, like a founder prototype.
No over‑engineering. Direct, clean, and practical.

If you want to continue improving it, feel free to fork and experiment.
