FitScore AI

A tiny ruthless tool that compares a job description with one or more resumes and tells you, with zero sugar-coating, who actually fits the role — and who’s faking it.

This is basically a “founder-style resume evaluator” powered by a Deno backend, Claude 3 Haiku, and a simple React + Tailwind UI.

It’s not fancy. It just works.

Why I Built This

After seeing founders complain that tons of resumes look like they were auto-optimized but don’t match real skills, I wanted something that:

Reads a JD

Reads multiple resumes

Scores them: FitScore + RiskScore

Spits out a blunt verdict

Generates a long-form “ruthless report” like a technical founder would

This is the tool I wanted while preparing for agent-infra roles (CoreSpeed, etc.) — and now it’s reusable for any job + resume combo.

Tech Stack
Frontend

React + TypeScript

Vite

TailwindCSS

Minimal state management (pure hooks)

Backend

Deno

Zypher Agent runtime

Claude 3 Haiku (Anthropic)

Simple JSON REST API

Infra

Local dev only for now

No DB, no auth, no cloud — intentionally simple

How It Works
1. Paste a Job Description

Usually something like “Senior Full-Stack Engineer, agent infra, Rust/Go/Deno, Kubernetes, Zypher”.

2. Add One or More Resumes

Text only — doesn't parse PDFs yet.

3. Hit Analyze

Backend sends each resume + JD into a Zypher-powered agent prompt that extracts:

FitScore (0–100)

RiskScore (0–100)

Verdict (1–2 lines)

Full founder-style report (multi-paragraph)

4. UI Shows Everything in a Table

Expandable rows for the detailed report.

Local Development
Backend
cd backend
deno task dev


Runs on:

http://localhost:8000


Make sure you have a .env file in /backend:

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here


(Do NOT commit this. GitHub push protection will block you.)

Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


Runs on:

http://localhost:5173


Frontend expects the backend at port 8000.

Example Output
Candidate 1 — FitScore 82, RiskScore 22

Founder-style verdict:

“Strong match. Real systems experience. Resume language looks natural. Missing a bit of Rust/Go depth but overall solid.”

Candidate 2 — FitScore 54, RiskScore 61

Founder-style verdict:

“A lot of JD keywords appear copy-pasted. Claims don’t line up. Risky hire.”

What’s Next (if I continue building this)

PDF → text extraction

Recruiter-style CSV export

Support for multiple JDs (batch mode)
